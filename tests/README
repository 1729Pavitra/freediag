Test suite for freediag subsystems.
Work in progress; the goal is to automate as much of this as possible.
Currently, cmake is required to run the tests.

Steps to use :
1) edit conf_l0_dumb.ini to set the desired serial port
2) "ctest -N" to list available tests
3) "ctest -I <x> -V" to try a specific test, with verbose output


**** Test validation
the runcli.cmake script compares stdout and stderr output each to their own "pass" and "fail" regexp, such that:
- if the pass RE isn't matched, the test fails
- if the fail RE is matched, the test fails
Those 4 regexps are optional and are in <testname>.std{o,e}_{p,f} files.

If no stderr output is expected, the file  <testname>.stde_f could contain a single period (.) to match any character
and therefore fail the test.

If no regex files are provided, the test will pass.
