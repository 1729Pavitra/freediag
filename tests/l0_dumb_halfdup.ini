# Test for dumb L0 interface, hooked up as half-duplex : test echo removal

# This is done either by connecting TXD with RXD on a serial port,
# or making sure the K line of the real interface is pulled up to +V (the interface usually takes care of this).
# In any case, do not connect to an ECU to run this !
