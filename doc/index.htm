  <p>Freediag is a suite of vehicle diagnostic protocols and an OBD II (mostly)
  compliant Scan Tool, currently for Linux platforms.

  <p>OBD II is a standard for vehicle diagnostics relating to emissions
  implemented on all US vehicles since the mid 1990s. Europe has just
  introduced a standard called EOBD which is basically the same.

  <p>The idea is that any garage/workshop will have a scantool and can diagnose
  vehicles with emissions problems - these are brought to the attention of the
  driver by a &quot;Check Engine&quot; light.

  <p>This suite also contains protocol suites for some manufacturer specific
  protocols such as the protocol used on some Mercedes Benz gearbox controllers.
  It is intended to add the VW diagnostic protocol shortly.

  <p>It is intended that this grow into a full blown diagnostic suite for
  configuring and checking faults on many vehicles.

  <p>There are 4 physical interfaces specified for vehicles, ISO9141 (K-Line),
  ISO14230 (effectively the same as ISO9141), SAE-J1850 VPW and SAE-J1850 PWM. A
  5<sup>th</sup> interface type (CANbus) is specified but not used for
  standardised OBDII diagnostics.

  <p>The bulk of the original code and design was written by Richard Almeida, the
  code was then checked and made more portable as the first stage of a project to
  make it portable to Windows by Andy Whittaker. Much work has been done by Bjorn
  Helgaas on enhancing the usability of the scantool, sanitising the comments in
  the code and adding functionality to the scantool.
