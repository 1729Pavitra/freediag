  <p>Freediag is an experimental suite of vehicle diagnostic protocols and an OBD II (mostly)
  compliant ScanTool, designed to run on Linux and Windows platforms natively.
  Only a command-line interface is provided at the moment.

  <p>OBD II is a standard for vehicle diagnostics relating to emissions
  implemented on all US vehicles since the mid 1990s. Europe has introduced a standard called EOBD which is basically the same.

  <p>The idea is that any garage/workshop will have a scantool and can diagnose
  vehicles with emissions problems - these are brought to the attention of the
  driver by a &quot;Check Engine&quot; light.

  <p>This suite also contains protocol suites for some manufacturer specific
  protocols such as the protocol used on some Mercedes Benz gearbox controllers.
  It is intended to add the VW and Nissan diagnostic protocols eventually.

  <p>It is intended that this grow into a full blown diagnostic suite for
  configuring and checking faults on many vehicles.

  <p>There are 4 physical interfaces specified for vehicles, ISO9141 (K-Line),
  ISO14230 (effectively the same as ISO9141), SAE-J1850 VPW and SAE-J1850 PWM. A
  5<sup>th</sup> interface type (CANbus) is increasingly popular.
  
  <p>Of important note is that no part of CANbus / ISO 15765 is supported by freediag at the moment.

  <p>
  The bulk of the original code and design was written by Richard Almeida, the
  code was then checked and made more portable as the first stage of a project to
  make it portable to Windows by Andy Whittaker. Much work has been done by Bjorn
  Helgaas on enhancing the usability of the scantool, sanitising the comments in
  the code and adding functionality to the scantool.
  <p>
  As of 2014, the project has been in a prolonged coma for the past years, with only a few commits
  now and then. Some changes in >2.6 linux kernels caused some timing problems which are possibly not
  entirely solved yet. Work done by current maintainer fenugrec enables freediag to run natively
  on Windows; support for ELMxxx based interfaces has also  been added recently.

  <p><b>Current Release:</b> 1.06  (2014-07-20)<br>
  Since release 1.01, freediag can run natively on Windows (i.e. without CYGWIN) as well as linux / unix-based platforms.

  <p>If the current packages available on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/freediag/">SourceForge</a>
  causes problems, the most recent code can be found in the git repositories mirrored on both Sourceforge and github
  (see links at the top of this page),  as the releases can be a few commits out of date. Any
  prospective user should be prepared to spend some time getting the package to work for their current
  setup. All bug reports and patches are welcome and should be submitted through the sourceforge project page.
