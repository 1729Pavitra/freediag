FREEDIAG - Free diagnostic software for OBD-II equipped motor vehicles.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains 'core' software (called 'scantool') which
can be used to access your car's diagnostic system using a laptop
and a suitable interface cable.

scantool's user interface is a somewhat primitive command-line
system - but it also has an application interface ("freediag AIF")
that lets more sophisticated programs use the freediag core whilst
presenting the user with a more appealing interface.

Under this directory are the following sub-directories:

doc      -- Documentation that applies to the package as a whole.
scantool -- Source code for the 'scantool' core package.
include  -- Include files that describe the interface between
            scantool and the GUI application(s).
scangui  -- A basic GUI interface to scantool.

Other GUI applications will appear over time.


LICENSING:
~~~~~~~~~~

scantool is licensed under GPL - but other packages found here
may have other OpenSource licensing arrangements - which is OK
because each is a separate program and does not link against
scantool.  Check in each directory for details.


AUTHORS:
~~~~~~~~

Each package contains a list of it's contributors.


INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you downloaded a 'released' version of freediag:

Each package has it's own installation instructions - but
running the 'install' script in this top level directory
should do all the work for you.  You'll likely need to run
this as 'root' in order to get write access to the directories
where freediag installs itself.

If you checked freediag out of CVS:

Each package contains a 'reconf' script that is called from
a master 'reconf' script at this level.  This runs the 'autotools'
to generate configure scripts and then calls 'make'.  It does not
do a 'make install'.

RUNNING:
~~~~~~~~

To run each application, you'll need an appropriate interface
to connect the serial port on a laptop computer to the
OBD-II port on your car.  With most available interfaces,
it would be inadvisable to use a computer powered from
wall socket because your car may not be adequately
grounded.
 
Check the README file in each tool directory for detailed instructions.
