This is a brief list of changes since freediag 1.0.0 , per release.
Refer to OLD_CHANGES for development history prior to 1.0.0

Since ~ 2011, CSB (fenugrec) has maintained the freediag project on sourceforge, albeit loosely.

He also took the liberty of modifying the version number format to MAJOR.MINOR, the MINOR number
written with 2 digits ( %02d if you will), and occasionally suffixed by a lower-case letter indicating
a snapshot of the CVS source tree.

*** Release 1.01 2014-03-04
Codename "phoenix zombie".
From the release notes :
- freediag now compiles and runs on Win32 ! Very preliminary pre-alpha status.
- A lot of small fixes, hopefully not breaking the rest of the codebase.
- bugfix : #15, diag_tty_break broken on win32 (64-bit ints)
- bugfix : #12, struct pid has a member named sprintf
- bugfix : #10, *printf format warnings / missing casts / other dumb errors
- bugfix : #8, shell script permissions

- old style device IDs no longer supported. Previously :
"set interface xyz 2" would use /dev/ttyOBDII2 as the device name. Now the full name must
be entered :
"set interface xyz /dev/ttyS0" for instance, or "set interface xyz \\.\COM16" on Win.
However the code is still in place for the old behavior. See CMakeLists.txt or otherwise define
OLD_DEVNAME before compiling. (i.e. "make -DOLD_DEVNAME" should do the trick with autotools)

- removed SE9141 and VAG interface files; they fall under the category "DUMB" and shared the exact same code ( diag_l0_dumb.c )
by default they will not build but the source files are still in the repo for a while.
To use a K-line only interface, use something like " set interface dumb /dev/ttyUSB2" ;
To use K + L line interfaces (VAGTOOL and some others), "set interface vagtool /dev/ttyS0".

- CMake build system (in addition to the old GNU autotools system). Mainly for Win32 but is
 supposed to work on linux, UNIX and OSX.
 
 
*** Release 1.00c 2011-06-09
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM preliminary support added, possibly filled with bugs.
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably
- Dumb serial interfaces (VAGTOOL, SE9141) are merged into one file, diag_l0_dumb.c . "set interface dumb /dev/ttyS0" will enable this interface.
- Next release will remove the separate VAGTOOL & SE device files. They will be totally replaced by the single "dumb" driver, which will be configurable to use (or not) the L-line. This was the only difference between the two drivers.


*** Release 1.00b 2011-05-29
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM support is still not complete (though under way)
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably


*** Release 1.00a 2011-05-21
A snapshot of the actual CVS tree, with the goal of making a source code package available for
download. Many people will not bother with CVS just to try some experimental software.
This was the first package released since freediag-0.3, and did not include many new features.
