This is a brief list of changes since freediag 1.0.0 , per release.
Refer to OLD_CHANGES for development history prior to 1.0.0

Since ~ 2011, CSB (fenugrec) has maintained the freediag project on sourceforge, albeit loosely.

He also took the liberty of modifying the version number format to MAJOR.MINOR, the MINOR number
written with 2 digits ( %02d if you will), and occasionally suffixed by a lower-case letter indicating
a snapshot of the CVS source tree.

*** Release 1.04 ; 2014-04-02
From the release notes:
This release fixes some minor issues and increases usability of the command-line tool.

New in 1.04:
diag_l0_dumb: added DIAG_L1_BLOCKDUPLEX flag to accelerate P4==0 half-duplex removal
scantool_debug: added l0test #7 and 8 for half duplex removal
Split diag_os.c into diag_os_unix and diag_os_win.c


Fixes: (summary of CVS commits)

Minor fix to scantool_cli.c htoi() with negative values
Added "bad checksum" flag to struct diag_msg.iflags
Changed L2 & L3 timer expiry mechanism (in struct diag_l2_conn, diag_l3_conn)
Replaced gettimeofday() by diag_os_getms() where monotonicity is needed (bug #14)
Added diag_os_chronoms() as a general purpose resettable stopwatch (mostly for logging)
Replaced gettimeofday() by diag_os_chronoms() for logging purposes  (bug #14)
CMake + autotools : added check for librt if required
diag_l0_sim.c : corrected sin() conversion to 8bit
diag_l2_timer: skip keepalive messages for connections marked as _CLOSING
diag_l2_iso14230: implemented StopCommunication request in _stopcomms()
scantool_debug.c: added text description of debug flags
Fixed diag_l0_sim not closing properly


*** Release 1.03 ; 2014-03-26
From the release notes:

New in 1.03:
-Major fixes in L0 code (introduced in previous overzealous clean-ups)
-iso14230 : l2_14230_startcomm: added decoding of the keybytes to use proper header format
-l2_14230_int_recv : added checksum verif
-added more tests to l0test command
-win: added diag_os_calibrate()
-win: added diag_os_millisleep auto-adjustment


Fixes: (summary of CVS commits)

-l0_recv *: do not diag_iseterr if diag_err_timeout (fixed regression)
-cmd_disconnect closes things properly now (bug #19)
-l2_14230 and l3_j1979 timeout callback : disable debug messages while sending keepalive
-Added L2 ioctl DIAG_IOCTL_IFLUSH to call diag_tty_iflush (bug #18)
-Improved disconnect + connection closing in diag_l2.c
-Fixed incomplete disconnect in diag_l2_stopcommunications()
-diag_tty_win.c : CreateFile with no buffering; always flushfilebuffers in _write()
-bug #17: removed debugging fprintf()s in critical sections


*** Release 1.02 2014-03-23
From the release notes:
Many fixes to win32 code.
New in 1.02:
Windows version has a lot of self-verification for timing, and a small amount of self-adjustment as well.
All platforms: there is now a special debugging mode for troubleshooting dumb interfaces.

Fixes: (summary of CVS commits)

diag_l0_dumb : fixed spurious detection of sync byte
diag_l0_elm : doesn't support raw L1 proto (only iso 9141 & 14230)
new L1 flag (DIAG_L1_AUTOSPEED) for smart interfaces
diag_l1_setspeed is only called from diag_l2_ioctl now
bug #16: removed function pointers in debugging messages
diag_tty_break win32 : added auto-adjustment of timeout (running average)
added L line polarity option for L0_dumb devices.
added optional diag_tty_fastbreak (specifically for iso14230 fast init)
diag_l0_dumb : added optional fastbreak & unified initbus functions
added TRY_POSIX build option in CMake and Autotools
bug #13: diag_l0_dumb uses manual 5bps init by default (MAN_BREAK) now.
cleaned some redundant delays (i.e. more than one level waiting W5 before initbus, etc.)
Sanitized alloc/free management in L2 startcomms & stopcomms functions
sanitized USE_RCFILE defines
A *lot* of code cleanup and commenting. freediag almost compiles without any warnings on at least a few platforms.
Misc improvements to the CMake build system.


*** Release 1.01 2014-03-04
Codename "phoenix zombie".
From the release notes :
- freediag now compiles and runs on Win32 ! Very preliminary pre-alpha status.
- A lot of small fixes, hopefully not breaking the rest of the codebase.
- bugfix : #15, diag_tty_break broken on win32 (64-bit ints)
- bugfix : #12, struct pid has a member named sprintf
- bugfix : #10, *printf format warnings / missing casts / other dumb errors
- bugfix : #8, shell script permissions

- old style device IDs no longer supported. Previously :
"set interface xyz 2" would use /dev/ttyOBDII2 as the device name. Now the full name must
be entered :
"set interface xyz /dev/ttyS0" for instance, or "set interface xyz \\.\COM16" on Win.
However the code is still in place for the old behavior. See CMakeLists.txt or otherwise define
OLD_DEVNAME before compiling. (i.e. "make -DOLD_DEVNAME" should do the trick with autotools)

- removed SE9141 and VAG interface files; they fall under the category "DUMB" and shared the exact same code ( diag_l0_dumb.c )
by default they will not build but the source files are still in the repo for a while.
To use a K-line only interface, use something like " set interface dumb /dev/ttyUSB2" ;
To use K + L line interfaces (VAGTOOL and some others), "set interface vagtool /dev/ttyS0".

- CMake build system (in addition to the old GNU autotools system). Mainly for Win32 but is
 supposed to work on linux, UNIX and OSX.
 
 
*** Release 1.00c 2011-06-09
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM preliminary support added, possibly filled with bugs.
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably
- Dumb serial interfaces (VAGTOOL, SE9141) are merged into one file, diag_l0_dumb.c . "set interface dumb /dev/ttyS0" will enable this interface.
- Next release will remove the separate VAGTOOL & SE device files. They will be totally replaced by the single "dumb" driver, which will be configurable to use (or not) the L-line. This was the only difference between the two drivers.


*** Release 1.00b 2011-05-29
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM support is still not complete (though under way)
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably


*** Release 1.00a 2011-05-21
A snapshot of the actual CVS tree, with the goal of making a source code package available for
download. Many people will not bother with CVS just to try some experimental software.
This was the first package released since freediag-0.3, and did not include many new features.
