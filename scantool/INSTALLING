If you have downloaded the freediag source code, then you need to run:

  ./configure ; make install

If you have checked out the latest development release from CVS, then run:

  ./reconf ; make install

NOTES:

1) The first time you run make, you should ignore the message
   about a missing ".depend" file, it will be created then.

2) If you alter the configure.ac file, you will need autoconf
   version 2.52 or later.
